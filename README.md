The objective of this project was to create a distributed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that could visualize and track the real-time location of vehicles which are running in Boston, MA. (using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) API). So, to implement this, I utilize the technologies, particularly Apache Spark and Kafka to process and analyze real-time data for streaming platforms and store events respectively. Additionally, I utilized ReactJS for the front-end development, creating an interactive map interface to display the vehicle locations. On the server side, I used Node.js to handle client-server communication and manage the application's backend logic. MongoDB was used as our backend database, providing strong storage and manipulation capabilities for handling large volumes of real-time data.
